                <h2 class="text-primary">The Problem</h2>
                <p class="lead">Provider attestations are essential but often viewed as burdensome. Every 90 days, providers must review lengthy forms to update various data fields—such as their practice location, licenses, insurance, and provider information (e.g., NPI)—within CAQH's Provider Data Portal.</p>
                
                <p>This process is time-consuming and, for many providers and proxies (e.g., practice managers), a significant barrier to care. Currently, providers must complete attestations so that their information remains accurate and visible in insurance plan directories, enabling patients to find their healthcare providers.</p>
                
                <p class="mt-4">We set out to answer the question: <strong class="text-primary">How might we transform attestation from a compliance task into a moment of mutual value for providers and the entire healthcare ecosystem?</strong></p>

                <p class="lead">Instead of periodic, manual attestations, we propose a new, distributed model called micro-attestations. This allows providers and proxies to verify or update their provider information directly within the tools they already use, seamlessly integrating attestations into their everyday workflows.</p>

                <p class="lead">Here is what we think this process can look like in the wild.</p>
                
                <p>Imagine you're a provider ordering new prescription pads. Normally, you would have to enter a lot of information—your National Provider Number (NPI), practice location, DEA license, and other details to verify your identity.</p>
                
                <p>With CAQH autofill, there's an embedded button on the website (e.g., RxMinutemanPress). Clicking it opens a panel that securely connects to your CAQH data, allowing you to log in and grant just the right amount of information to complete the form.</p>

                <p>By becoming an OAuth provider, CAQH has the potential to transform the healthcare industry. Providers could log into websites across the healthcare ecosystem (e.g., Zocdoc, UpToDate, Epic, Walgreens, UPMC) using their CAQH account.</p>
                
                <p>This would enable automatic and secure data exchange for everything related to provider information, streamlining workflows and potentially eliminating the need for some forms entirely.</p>
